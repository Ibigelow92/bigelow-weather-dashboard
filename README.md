# weather-dashboard

##Description

The purpose of this project was to get more familiar with using server-side APIs. The API used for this project was openweathermap.org. I became more familiar with the process of reading through the documentation to see how to use an unfamiliar API. As for the function of the application itself, the weather dashboard is supposed to give the user the current weather in a given city, along with a 5-day forecast. The user should also be able to save previous searches. 

##Installation

To use the application, simply follow this link: https://ibigelow92.github.io/bigelow-weather-dashboard/. To have the application on your device, you can also clone the repository. 

##Usage

To use the application, type the name of the city you wish to search into the input box. This will return the weather info for it. 

##Credits

The app was created using the API openweathermap.org. This YouTube tutorial provided my conceptual basis for how to create the current weather card: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZNG8UomjSI.
